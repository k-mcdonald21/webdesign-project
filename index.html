            <h3>Baku becomes latest race to be postponed</h3>
            <img src="images/article.jpg" alt="Article" width="500">
            <p>The wait for the 2020 season to get underway has been extended by another week with the news that the Azerbaijan Grand Prix has now been postponed
                Following all of the other cancellations and postponements, Baku was set to host the first race of a truncated 2020 season on 7 June, but that will no longer be the case of yup, you guessed it, the coronavirus pandemic.

                Unlike the straight cancellations of Australia and Monaco, Azerbaijan joins Bahrain, Vietnam, China, Netherlands, and Spain in being merely postponed, with the hope if being slotted into a revised calendar later in the season if possible.<a href="news.html">Read More...</a></p>

            <p>24th March, 1991 - Brazilian GP
               After years of trying, Ayrton Senna finally managed to win his home race - albeit not without some difficulties and a dose of luck. Nigel Mansell was catching him rapidly in the closing stages before the gearbox on his Williams broke, and towards the end Riccardo Patrese was also reeling him in. Senna himself was nursing how own gearbox issues - by the closing laps heâ€™d lost everything but sixth gear (not ideal given that Interlagos has quite a few slow corners). He just managed to hold on and win but the effort destroyed him - he had to be lifted from his car after the race and could barely stand on the podium.</p>
